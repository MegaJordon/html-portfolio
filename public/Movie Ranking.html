<p>This is my favourite anime. Lots of wacky adventures but
    at the same time very entertaining and gets you hooked!</p>

<h3>Sword Art Online</h3>

<p>This use to be my favourite anime. If you can't tell already, i love the
    fantasy type of animes. The main character of this anime is stuck in a video game
    and always gets involved in situations where he is the only one who can save everyone</p>

<h3>Love Live</h3>

<p>There are many Love Lives Anime but the animation of the dances and the way how all the idols meet each other
 is what every Love Live series do really well. You can get really engaged and also emotional when watching this so beware!</p>
